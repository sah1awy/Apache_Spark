# PySpark Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains various PySpark projects that I have worked on, showcasing my skills in big data processing and analysis. In these projects, I utilized both RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) and DataFrames, depending on the specific requirements and performance considerations.

### RDDs vs DataFrames
- **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**
  - RDDs are a low-level abstraction that provides fault tolerance and distributed processing capabilities.
  - They are particularly effective for performing transformations and actions in a functional programming style, making them suitable for complex data manipulation tasks.
  - RDDs excel in **map-reduce** operations, where operations like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` are executed efficiently across distributed clusters.
  
- **DataFrames**
  - DataFrames provide a higher-level abstraction that is similar to tables in relational databases, allowing for structured data manipulation.
  - They come with an optimized execution engine that leverages Catalyst for query optimization, making them more efficient for SQL-like operations.
  - DataFrames are better suited for querying structured data with specified schemas, enabling operations like filtering, aggregating, and joining data using familiar SQL syntax.

### Project Highlights
- Each project demonstrates the application of either RDDs or DataFrames based on the task requirements.
- Projects include various data processing tasks, such as:
  - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
  - Data cleansing and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Performance tuning and optimization strategies
  - Modeling using Linear Regression and ALS Movie Recommendation model
